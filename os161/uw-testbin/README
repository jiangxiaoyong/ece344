The idea of this directory is to collect Waterloo created
programs here so that when moving to new versions of OS161
we have them all in one place and we know what we need
to move/port. Its structure and functionality is
similar to the testbin except to simply the
Makefile in each directory they all include uw-prog.mk
from this directory.

Here we provide a very brief description of the different tests. More
information about each individual test is available in the source files.

syscall   - example program: how a syscall works used in the course notes
segments  - example program: how different segments used in the course notes
argtest   - is a useful program that I ask people to use when 
            when trying to implement argc/argv.

common    - some code that is common to some of the vm-* tests
vm-*      - are a bunch of different test programs I wrote
            to try to test the VM subsystem for assignment 3.

lib       - some libraries that are used by other programs
files1    - test a number of relatively simple case for
files2      open, close, read and write
writeread - write stuff to a file and then read it and ensure what
            is read matches what was written
conc-io   - tests concurrent writes and atomicity

fork_*   - test funtionality of file i/o in conjunction with fork

The following tests were created by students as part of an initiative to
improve the suite of tests available.

adrian2     - test i/o after fork
adrian3     - test memory management when memory is filled
jeremy2     - test i/o after fork
samuel2     - test i/o after fork
stephen3    - test efficiency of page replacement
