My-Testbin Documentation

The my-testbin folder is designed to be recompiled with the remainder of the testcases. 
Whenever make <depend|clean|vclean|all> is executed at $OS161TOP (../) my-testbin will be recompiled.

The compilation process iterates over all subdirectories of my-testbin, compiling and linking the code within them.
The final executable will have the name of the directory. 
Thus, every testcase is uniquly identified by the folder name.

HOWTOs:

Create a new Testcase:

* Create a new folder in OS161TOP/my-testbin
* Add the .c and .h source to the directory
* Ensure that the directory is self contained, I haven't tested linkage against sources outside of newly created dir
* Go to OS161TOP or OS161TOP/my-testbin and execute `make`
* Finally run `make install` to copy the binaries to root/

Running new testcases:

* The new testcases will be installed in root/my-testbin
* run them with "p my-testbin/<testname>"
